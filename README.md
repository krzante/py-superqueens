# n-Queens Solver

This project implements a solver for the n-queens problem using two different
local search strategies: steepest hill climbing and simulated annealing.

The objective of the n-queens problem is to place n queens in a n x n chessboard
so that no queens attack each other.

The following is an example of a solution for an 8x8 board generated by the
program:

```
- - - - - - X -
- X - - - - - -
- - - - - X - -
- - X - - - - -
X - - - - - - -
- - - X - - - -
- - - - - - - X
- - - - X - - -
```

## Running the solver

This project was tested on a Python 3.8 environment. To run the program, type in
the command

```python run_solver.py```

The program will ask to input the dimension of the n x n board, then display the
initial state and the two possible solutions generated by the two algorithms
(which might be successful or not).

## More about the solver

This program solves the n-queens problem by first placing n queens at random
in a chessboard. It then uses two different search strategies to try to solve
the problem.

My implementation of the simulated annealing search strategy can solve the
problem about 91% of the time, and with some tweaks at the expense of much
slower runtime it can reach about 95%. The steepest hill climbing implementation
only solves the problem about 14% of the time.
